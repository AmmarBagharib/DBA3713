In this assignment, we revisit the LendingClub credit lending problem, but on a more realistic data set. We will extend the model by considering more features such as loan amount, term, interest rate, and grade. Our final goal is to explore the performance of logistic regression and its variants.

Here, we explore the expected payoffs of borrowers of LendingClub through the use different machine learning models. From the most simple logistics regression model to more complex models through regularisation . 

We also explore different regularised models and observe the impact they have on the (simulated) test loss of the loaning data of LendingClub.
