# DBA3713
Repository for DBA3713 Analytics for Risk Management
This Module was taught under NUS BBA by Prof Feng Yifan. This module introduces tools in business analytics for quantitative risk management. More specifically, it covers machine learning, statistical modelling, and optimisation methods to model, estimate, and manage risk

Ultimately, the focus of this module was on larning to “manage” risk by trying to answer the following questions:

1. How to model and assess risk?
2. How to control and limit risk exposure?
3. And ultimately, how to make better decisions in the face of uncertainty?

The Codes present in this repository were as part of my groupwork together with:

Lo Hei Ting, Loh Yee Shing Bryan and Aaron Yuen Sze Tian.
